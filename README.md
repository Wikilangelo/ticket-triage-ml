## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning prototype** developed for an academic Project Work.  
The goal is to automatically perform **ticket triage** by:

- Classifying tickets into the correct **category**
- Suggesting an **operational priority**

The system simulates a real business environment where companies receive many daily support requests.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The prototype demonstrates how **basic ML techniques** can:

✔ Reduce manual ticket sorting  
✔ Improve response times  
✔ Standardize classification  
✔ Support human operators in repetitive tasks  

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is **synthetic**, created specifically for the project, as required by the assignment guidelines.

Each ticket includes:

| Field | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | Ticket identifier |
| oggetto | Short title |
| descrizione | Full description |
| categoria | Ticket category (Admin / Technical / Commercial) |
| priorità | Operational priority (Low / Medium / High) |

The text used by the model is obtained by combining **title + description**.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

This project uses **Supervised Learning**.

### Text Processing
- Text is converted into numbers using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- This highlights important words while reducing common ones

### Classification Model
The model used is **Logistic Regression**, chosen because:

✔ Simple and interpretable  
✔ Works well with small datasets  
✔ Fast to train  
✔ Suitable for text classification  

Two models are trained:
- One for **Category**
- One for **Priority**

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Model performance is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

These metrics ensure the model is reasonably reliable for a prototype.

---

## 🖥️ Web Interface

A simple **Streamlit dashboard** allows users to:

1. Insert ticket title and description  
2. Get predicted category  
3. Get predicted priority  
4. View model confidence

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wikilangelo/ticket-triage-ml.git
cd ticket-triage-ml
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

If you have a `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Otherwise install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit
```

### 3️⃣ Train the models (optional, if needed)

```bash
python main.py
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

This is a **prototype**, not a production system.

- Dataset is small and synthetic  
- Language complexity is limited  
- High priority tickets should always be reviewed by humans  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use real-world datasets  
- Integrate advanced NLP models  
- Continuous model retraining  
- Integration with real ticketing systems  

---

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of a university Project Work in **Machine Learning for Business Processes**, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and reproducibility.

---

## 🤝 Human + AI Collaboration

The system is designed to **support**, not replace, human operators.  
It provides initial classification while leaving final decisions to people.
